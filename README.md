# Phonophonia

This application is a Ruby on Rails API for storing tracks and playlists for
users.  Users can create, update, and delete tracks, as well as create and delete playlists.
Users can also view tracks and playlists belonging to other users, as well as incorporate
other user's tracks into their own playlists.

# Development Process and Problem-Solving Strategy
Please see the back-end component of this project for more information about
our planning process, and more: https://github.com/ripleyofvenus/Phonophonia-API

The front end of this project I'm eager to continue work on. Most of my time during
project week, and then again for resubmittal (2.5 working days in my case) was spent
on the front end. I worked first through connecting the CRUD actions from the back end to
the front, rendering content to the page through handlebars and basic html markup,
then SCSS and rounds of debugging.
I'm eager to continue work on this project, and in future I intend to...
- continue cleaning up styling and formatting to be more user appealing.
- Embed an audio player, either a widget or/and one of my own making.
- connecting a third party API for the user to be able to search for sounds through a searchbar on the page.

# User Stories
